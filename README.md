Oltris is a simple, but challenging puzzle.

Pay attention! The first 10 levels provide the key for solving the whole game.

The main goal of the game is to rearrange the blocks in the lower row of the Game field so that they match the color of the blocks in the upper row of the Puzzle field. Empty blocks cannot move. Blocks in the bottom line of the Game field must be empty (without moves).
